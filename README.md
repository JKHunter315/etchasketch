This is a project from TheOdinProjects web development course. The project was to design an etch a sketch website with a canvas. 
When the user moves the mouse over the canvas, it changes color to black. If the user hits the reset button, the webpage prompts the user to ender the number of rows and columns they want, 
which is then used to build the new canvas, but the canvas itself does not change size.
